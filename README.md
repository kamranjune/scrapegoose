# ScrapeGoose

This app uses:

   1. express

   2. express-handlebars

   3. mongoose

   4. cheerio

   5. axios


Articles are populated initially with Handlebars.

Scrape first and then click on each article to leave a note.  You can also delete a note by clicking X next to the note.

The note displays in the input box.  This app is a combination of Mongoose Activity 11 and Mongoose Activity 20.

### Programming Notes:  
A foreign key is made for the Link between Articles and Notes in the Mongo Database via Mongoose.  Also I made this app in both a JQUERY version and Handlebars version.  

The handlebars version is posted to heroku.
